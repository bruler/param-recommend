	\section{Building the library}

	The library can be build via the provided makefile, which by default uses the ``gcc'' compiler.\newline\newline
	The target \emph{lib} builds the static library and target \emph{shared} builds the shared library.
	By default the makefile compiles without the compiler flag \emph{-fPIC} (position independent code) which is
	needed for generating the shared library, though.\newline\newline
	Optionally one could alter compiler flags in the makefile before building the library.

	\section{Building the library running Windows}

	The libNMF library was successfully built under Windows XP by using ``Cygwin''. We alternatively testes the installation using ``Windows Services for UNIX'' and ``MinGW'' but both failed with errors when calling the Makefile. 

	\section{Linking the library}

	Linking the library requires linking of ARPACK, BLAS and LAPACK libraries as well.

	\section{Usage}

	This library can be used by either calling \emph{nmfDriver} or the individual computational routines for
	a non negative matrix factorization. The following example files can be found in the directory ``example''.\newline

	An example call for the first case can be found in the file ``example.c''.\newline

	An example call for the second case can be found in the file ``example\_withoutdriver.c''\newline
